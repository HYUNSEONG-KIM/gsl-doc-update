The *.c files in this directory were created by the
program f2c, which translates Fortran code to C code.
The primary purpose of this set of files is to provide
means to create  six executable files:
 diehard, makewhat, diequick, getrnor, asc2bin, meld
from the six C files
 diehard.c, makewhat.c, diequick.c, getrnor.c, meld.c,
thus getting the DIEHARD battery of tests.

Please note that the Fortran source files for DIEHARD
are a mixture of patched and addended Fortran files
going back over thirty years.  They were gathered to
provide the DIEHARD battery of tests and the makewhat
exec file for generating various kinds of RNG's.  The
resulting mix seems to suit my purposes, but if you
want to examine particular *.c files for details of
testing or generating procedures, you may have difficulty.
The f2c translation is meant for machines, not people,
and even if relation to the original Fortran file were
transparent, you might still have problems because the
Fortran file may itself be a mix of earlier working
versions, or because of steps necessary to overcome
Fortran's quaint insistence on signed integers and the
un-mathematical way it decides I < J?

Whatever, if you compile these *.c files you should get
a working version of DIEHARD.   Be sure to link with
the f2c and math libraries.  A typical command might go

    gcc -o diehard diehard.c -lf2c -lm
